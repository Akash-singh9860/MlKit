## 📥 Installation

Clone and import the project into **Android Studio**:
git clone https://github.com/Akash-singh9860/MlKit.git
cd MlKit

- Open Android Studio.
- Select Open → MlKit.
- Allow Gradle sync and build to finish.
- Run on an emulator or physical device.
⚠️ Ensure your device/emulator has Camera support and ML Kit dependencies resolved.

---

## 🔍 Usage

- Grant camera and storage permissions when prompted.
- Capture a photo containing text or pick an image.
- The app will extract text using ML Kit’s text recognition.
- Extracted text will be passed through ML Kit translation to your configured language
